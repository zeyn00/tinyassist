This is TinyAssist. A mini voice assistant project based on an ESP32 and powered by Home Assistant Voice Assist.

**You will need the following:**
- M5Stack Atom Echo device
- Terminals 3D model. [Here is the link](https://www.printables.com/model/160473-terminal-for-ssd1306-13-oled-and-wemos-d1-mini-new)
- The 3D model of the Atom Echo’s frame. [Here is the link](https://makerworld.com/tr/models/2063557-frame-for-m5stach-atom-echo#profileId-2228227)
-

I had an unused M5Stack Atom Echo device, so I decided to build a small voice assistant for my workshop with it. This is not my main assistant, so I don’t really care about the Echo’s weak speaker. But if you want, you can follow the steps in this video to route the audio to another device:

You can also make another media_player device perform TTS by adding the following line of code to your ESPHome YAML file.

```yaml
voice_assistant:
  on_tts_start:
    - homeassistant.service:
        service: tts.speak
        data:
          # Set this to the entity ID of your OpenAI TTS (or Piper TTS) entity
          entity_id: tts.piper
          cache: "false"
          # Set this to your external media player
          media_player_entity_id: media_player.your_media_player
          message: !lambda 'return x;'
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE**
“Due to the shape of the original terminal’s 3D model, it’s unfortunately not possible to power the Atom Echo with standard Type-C cables. Therefore, you either need to use an external 90-degree slim cable like the one in the link below, or supply power to the device through the pins (which is the method I chose).”
